# StepDub

StepDub is a little PhoneGap app for making sounds while you walk.

# Installation / Copying

Right now there's nothing really in the repo, so there's nothing much worth
installing. (Feel free to fork my debug stuff, though.)

Once the app is finished, I'd like to make a PhoneGap shim so users with
sufficiently advanced browsers on their phones can demo the app for free
that way. However, for proper "install from the app store" app support, I
humbly request that people buy the app from the store (I'm thinking it'll be
about $2). If you *really* want to for your own personal use, you can compile
your own apk / whatever from this repo (you'll be missing out on automatic
updates from the store, of course), but please don't redistribute it.
